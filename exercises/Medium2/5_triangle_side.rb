# A triangle is classified as follows:

# equilateral All 3 sides are of equal length
# isosceles 2 sides are of equal length, while the 3rd is different
# scalene All 3 sides are of different length
# To be a valid triangle, the sum of the lengths of the two shortest sides must be greater than the length of the longest side, and all sides must have lengths greater than 0: if either of these conditions is not satisfied, the triangle is invalid.

# Write a method that takes the lengths of the 3 sides of a triangle as arguments, and returns a symbol :equilateral, :isosceles, :scalene, or :invalid depending on whether the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, scalene, or invalid.

# Examples:

def triangle(side1, side2, side3)
  sides = [side1, side2, side3]
  max_side = sides.max
  
  case 
  when side1 == 0 || side2 == 0 || side3 == 0 || 2 * max_side > sides.reduce(:+)
    :invalid
  when side1 == side2 && side2 == side3
    :equilateral
  when side1 == side2 || side1 == side3 || side2 == side3
    :isosceles
  else
    :scalene
  end
end
triangle(3, 3, 3) == :equilateral
triangle(3, 3, 1.5) == :isosceles
triangle(3, 4, 5) == :scalene
triangle(0, 3, 3) == :invalid
triangle(3, 1, 1) == :invalid
